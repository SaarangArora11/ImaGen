# ImaGen
Generate your Images and stylise them!

## Introduction
This is a AI Image generator project that I undertook for one of my university courses. This Image generator combines functionalities from 2-3 different pre-existing image generation models into 1.
The model will be able to take in a textual prompt, convert it into an image and then one can chose to select a pre-trained style and apply that to the generated image.

## Credits
The models have been taken from teh following sources
1) Huggingface Diffusers - https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
